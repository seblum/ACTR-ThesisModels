# ACTR-ThesisModels


### Folders / Models

* ACT-R Version 7.21
* Thesis: Engine Fire
* Thesis: Windshear
* Paper: Engine Fire


### Run

1. Start ACT-R. If you import actr it in python, it should state that actr is set. Otherwise it runs an error. It might be that the actr.py from the actr-distribution needs to be copied into the home directory of python or that you change your home directory accordingly.

3. Run ***RUN-metamodel.py***. The ACT-R models are loaded within the script. Both terminals (in the python GUI and in ACT-R) should show the ACT-R trace if activated


### Known Problems

When the computer got on standby or even if the screen goes black it did not work properly to run all scenarios. So if you want to leave the room and do other stuff, turn on a video so the computer keeps on running.
